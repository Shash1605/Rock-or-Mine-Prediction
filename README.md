Hello there!,
             This is a simple project for me being a beginner in the datasciecnce field and I have got the idea on how to work on the datasets. Basically in this project I have created the Machine Learning model which predicts whether the object is either 'Rock' or 'Mine' on giving the input data. And I should say it's a good practice for upskilling in the datascience field and I hope you find helpful with the project that I have shared.
